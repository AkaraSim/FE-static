                  He received his Master of Science in Mechanics of Materials
                  and Structures in 2013. In 2017, he graduated with his PhD
                  from the University of Girona in Spain. His research focused
                  on understanding low velocity impact on unconventional
                  laminated composite materials, and their compression behavior
                  by means of Mechanical Testing and Finite Element Modelling.
                  The aim was to guide the design of new laminates with better
                  performance for aerospace applications. Before joining MISTI,
                  he worked in the Department of Industrial and Mechanical
                  Engineering at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC).
                  He taught Materials Science, Introduction to Computer
                  Programming with Matlab, and Structural Analysis. He was also
                  the head of Mechanical Testing Laboratory and led a
                  Laboratory-Based Education (LBE) team. In addition, he
                  mentored and guided students to gain experiences in practical
                  engineering and research projects funded by private companies
                  and JICA.
